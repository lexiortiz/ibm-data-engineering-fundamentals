        "- Elements in a tuple are accessed using indexing, including negative indexing.\n",
        "- Tuples can be concatenated or sliced.\n",
        "- They are **immutable**, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "- To manipulate a tuple, a new tuple must be created.\n",
        "- The `sorted()` function returns a sorted list from a tuple.\n",
        "- Tuples can be **nested**, containing other tuples or complex data structures.\n",

        "### Lists\n",
        "- Lists are also ordered sequences, but they are **mutable**.\n",
        "- Lists are represented using square brackets `[]` and can contain various data types.\n",
        "- Like tuples, lists support indexing, negative indexing, slicing, and concatenation.\n",
        "- **Key difference**: Unlike tuples, lists can be modified after creation.\n",
        "- Methods like `extend()` and `append()` modify lists by adding elements.\n",
        "- The `del` command removes elements from a list.\n",
        "- The `split()` method converts a string into a list based on a delimiter.\n",
        "- **Aliasing** occurs when two variables reference the same list, meaning changes in one affect the other.\n",
