# IBM Data Engineering Fundamentals

## Overview

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and projects from the **IBM Data Engineering Fundamentals learning path**, offered through Verizon Skill Forward. The program covers foundational concepts, hands-on skills, and real-world applications in **data engineering**.

## Program Structure

The program consists of **six courses**, each focusing on different aspects of data engineering:

1. **Data Engineering Basics for Everyone** – Introduction to data engineering concepts, data lifecycle, and ecosystem.
2. **Python Basics for Data Science** – Fundamentals of Python, data structures, file handling, APIs, and libraries like Pandas & NumPy.
3. **Python for Data Engineering Project** – Hands-on projects using Python for data engineering workflows.
4. **Relational Database Basics** – Introduction to relational databases, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM Db2.
5. **SQL for Data Science** – SQL queries, functions, stored procedures, and database transactions.
6. **SQL Concepts for Data Engineers** – Advanced SQL concepts like optimization, indexing, and complex queries.

## Goals

- Document my data engineering journey.
- Provide structured notes and practical examples.
- Build projects that demonstrate real-world skills.
- Share insights with others learning data engineering.
